Score the maximum amplitude that is seen at any time as the final score. Rate only the amplitude and not the persistence or the intermittency of the tremor. As part of this rating, the patient should sit quietly in a chair with the hands placed on the arms of the chair (not in the lap) and the feet comfortably supported on the floor for 10 seconds with no other directives. Rest tremor is assessed separately for all four limbs and also for the lip/jaw. Rate only the
maximum amplitude that is seen at any time as the final rating."

The first pull is an instructional demonstration and is purposely milder and not rated. The second time the shoulders are pulled briskly and forcefully towards the examiner with enough force to displace the center of gravity so that patient MUST take a step backwards. The examiner needs to be ready to catch the patient, but must stand sufficiently back so as to allow enough room for the patient to take several steps to recover independently. Do not allow the patient to flex the body abnormally forward in anticipation of the pull. Observe for the number of steps backwards or falling. Up to and including two steps for recovery is considered normal, so abnormal ratings begin with three steps. If the patient fails to understand the test, the examiner can repeat the
