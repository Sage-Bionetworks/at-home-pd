mdsupdrs_partiii,substudy_mdsupdrs_part_iii,"<center><font size=4>Part III: Motor Examination",descriptive,"
<span style=""font-weight:normal""> Overview: This portion of the scale assesses the motor signs of PD. In administering Part III of the MDS-UPDRS
the examiner should comply with the following guidelines:

At the top of the form, mark whether the patient is on medication for treating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease and, if on levodopa, the time since the last dose.

Also, if the patient is receiving medication for treating the symptoms of Parkinson's disease, mark the patient's clinical state using the following definitions: </span>
<span style=""font-weight:strong"">ON </span><span style=""font-weight:normal"">is the typical functional state when patients are receiving medication and have a good response.
</span><span style=""font-weight:strong"">OFF<span style=""font-weight:normal""> is the typical functional state when patients have a poor response in spite of taking medications.

The investigator should ""rate what you see"". Admittedly, concurrent medical problems such as stroke, paralysis, arthritis, contracture, and orthopedic problems such as hip or knee replacement and scoliosis may interfere with individual items in the motor examination. In situations where it is absolutely impossible to test (e.g., amputations, plegia, limb in a cast), use the notation ""</span><span style=""font-weight:strong"">UR</span><span style=""font-weight:normal"">"" for Unable to Rate. Otherwise, rate the performance of each task as the patient performs in the context of co-morbidities.

All items must have an integer rating (no half points, no missing ratings).

Specific instructions are provided for the testing of each item. These should be followed in all instances. The investigator demonstrates while describing tasks the patient is to perform and rates function immediately thereafter. For Global Spontaneous Movement and Rest Tremor items (3.14 and 3.17), these items have been placed purposefully at the end of the scale because clinical information pertinent to the score will be obtained throughout the entire examination.

At the end of the rating, indicate if dyskinesia (chorea or dystonia) was present at the time of the examination, and if so, whether these movements interfered with the motor examination.

",radio,"<span style=""font-weight:normal""><u>Instructions to examiner</u>: The test examines the response to sudden body displacement produced by a <u>quick, forceful</u> pull on the shoulders while the patient is standing erect with eyes open and feet comfortably apart and parallel to each other. Test retropulsion. Stand behind the patient and instruct the patient on what is about to happen. Explain that s/he is allowed to take a step backwards to avoid falling. There should be a solid wall behind the examiner, at least 1-2 meters away to allow for the observation of the number of retropulsive steps. The first pull is an instructional demonstration and is purposely milder and not rated. The second time the shoulders are pulled briskly and forcefully towards the examiner with enough force to displace the center of gravity so that patient MUST take a step backwards. The examiner needs to be ready to catch the patient, but must stand sufficiently back so as to allow enough room for the patient to take several steps to recover independently. Do not allow the patient to flex the body abnormally forward in anticipation of the pull. Observe for the number of steps backwards or falling. Up to and including two steps for recovery is considered normal, so abnormal ratings begin with three steps. If the patient fails to understand the test, the examiner can repeat the
test so that the rating is based on an assessment that the examiner feels reflects the patient's limitations rather than misunderstanding or lack of preparedness. Observe standing posture for item 3.13.
